# Cube nets

These pdfs each show a cube net with tabs so that it can be cut and folded into a cube. The cubes are colored to illustrate how Peres' counterexample to the 'Free Will Conjecture' work.

Each cube contains 66 colored points which correspond to the 33 directions. In cube.pdf, to each pair of points there corresponds a line of the same color. This is the 'equator', or the intersection of the plane of points orthogonal to that direction with the surface of the cube.

The file cube_s.pdf is the same, except that only the planes orthogonal to points lying on one face of the cube have been drawn. This makes it slightly easier to read the colors.

You can read David Fremlin's discussion of this problem and solution in https://www1.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/n15l31.pdf . Fremlin cites Peres A. [91] ‘Two simple proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem’, J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 24 (1991) L175 as the source of this configuration.
